# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Getting Started

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Family Budget Tracker. It's people like you that make Family Budget Tracker such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

- QA: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- Marketing: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
- Community: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local user group, ...
- Code: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/maksymzav/my-budget/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free course [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it.

Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge. It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

## How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
